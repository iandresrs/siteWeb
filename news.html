            According to data accessed by EL MUNDO, on the beaches of Cabo de Gata, such as Níjar, San José and Las
            Negras, 23 boats circulate per day, many of which were jet skis, as official records do not distinguish by
            type. One vehicle with a total of 191 people on board. This extraordinary surge of boats and jet skis put
            the Armed Investigations Institute personnel to the test. And they quickly proved inadequate to deal with
            the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            All alerts were then triggered in Murcia and the Balearic Islands with six boats with more than 100 people
            on board in 24 hours at the beginning of June. The day after this alert, a semi-rigid boat arrived on the
            east coast. These three coastal areas are considered hotspots of illegal immigration, according to the
            official data collected by these new waves that have caught the attention of the Ministry of the Interior.
            So far this year, the Balearic Islands has received 8,702 people in 192 boats. The figure for Almeria is
            also overwhelming: 1,649 people and 170 boats, many of them jet skis. Finally, Murcia registered the arrival
            of 697 migrants in 64 smaller boats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jucil, the majority of the Civil Guard, will acquire a stake in the Secretary of Communication Agustín Lille
            after months of reproaches. “The current government and the Ministry of the Interior itself continue to fail
            in their work, putting an end to the illegal immigrants who arrive on our shores. Especially in states like
            Almería, there is an urgent shortage of Civil Guard troops. It is alarming. In Almeria, all army patrols
            must focus on immigrants, with the exception of civil security, before the small boats we receive arrive.”
            reel.

          </p>
          <p>
            “In migration issues, the law must be applied and the rule of law must be enforced. The exercise of
            political command must be responsible. Jucil calls on the politicians of the current administration to take
            responsibility in this regard. It is unacceptable that the Civil Guard is always kept to a minimum.
