            Officers check their passports and those of other new arrivals and detain them to process their asylum
            claims.

            This scene was repeated several times a day before the unsuspecting gaze of the security forces. "No, it
            never ends. They can cross the border anytime, anywhere," said a National Guard soldier, who did not want to

            Tightening security in recent months has failed to stem the flow of visa-free immigrants. In May,
            authorities detained more than 239,000 people at the border with Mexico, a record number, although that
            number includes people who have repeatedly tried to enter the United States.
